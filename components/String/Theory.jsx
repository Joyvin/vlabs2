				<strong>String Functions:</strong>
			</h2>
			<p>
				String functions are a set of operations and methods that
				manipulate and work with strings, which are sequences of
				characters. Strings are a fundamental data type in programming
				and are used extensively for various purposes. String functions
				provide essential tools for processing and manipulating text
				data. Here are the key components and common operations related
				to string functions:

			<h2>
				<strong>Components of String Functions:</strong>
			</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<span className="uline">Strings:</span> These are sequences
					of characters, and they serve as the input and output for
					string functions. Strings can contain letters, numbers,
					symbols, and whitespace.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br />
			<h2>
				<strong>Basic String Operations:</strong>
			</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<span className="uline">Concatenation:</span> This operation
					combines two or more strings to create a new string. It is
					often denoted by the `+` operator or a specific function.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span className="uline">Substring:</span> Substring
					operations extract a portion of a string. You can specify
					the starting and ending indices to define the
					substring&apos;s boundaries.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span className="uline">Length:</span> The length operation
					returns the number of characters in a string, helping you
					determine its size.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span className="uline">Search and Replace:</span> These
					operations allow you to search for specific substrings
					within a string and replace them with other substrings.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span className="uline">Case Conversion:</span> String
					functions can convert the case of characters within a
					string, such as changing text to uppercase or lowercase.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br />
			<h2>
				<strong>Common Use Cases:</strong>
			</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<span className="uline">Text Processing:</span> String
					functions are frequently used for processing and
					manipulating text data in applications, including data
					cleaning, validation, and transformation.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span className="uline">User Input Validation:</span> They
					are essential for validating user inputs, ensuring that data
					entered by users conforms to specific rules or formats.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span className="uline">Parsing:</span> String functions are
					crucial for parsing data formats like JSON, XML, and CSV,
					where strings need to be broken down into structured data.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span className="uline">String Comparison:</span> You can
					use string functions to compare strings, check for equality,
					or determine their order based on lexicographic (dictionary)
					sorting.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span className="uline">String Manipulation:</span> These
					functions allow you to manipulate strings by removing
					whitespace, trimming, padding, or extracting specific
					information from them.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</>
